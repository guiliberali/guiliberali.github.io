I am a researcher and professor at Erasmus University and visiting researcher ("wetenschappelijk onderzoeker") at Erasmus Medical Center.  
I like to solve thorny problems in sequential decision-making, such as adaptive trials (clinical trials and online experiments) and recommendation systems.
My expertise lies in areas that are growing in importance in marketing science including multi-arm bandits, reinforcement learning, sequential decision-making, Bayesian learning, machine learning, and recommendation systems.
 
My editorial experience includes co-editing a special issue of Management Science on prescriptive analytics, co-editing a special issue of IJRM, being a member of the ediutorial board at IJRM, and reviewing manuscripts for Marketing Science, Management Science, Journal of Marketing Research and IJRM. 

My on-going research projects include arm design for multi-armed bandits, fairness in bandits, seeding and targeting bandits, and adaptive clinical trials.
