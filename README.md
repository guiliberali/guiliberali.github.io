I am a researcher and professor at Erasmus University and visiting researcher ("wetenschappelijk onderzoeker") at Erasmus MC.  
I like to solve thorny problems in sequential decision-making, such as adaptive trials (clinical trials and online experiments) and recommendation systems using machine learning, dynamic programming,  multi-armed bandits, and adaptive sampling
