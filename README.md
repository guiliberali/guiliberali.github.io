I am a researcher and professor at Erasmus University and visiting researcher ("wetenschappelijk onderzoeker") at the Erasmus Medical Center.  
I like to solve thorny problems in sequential decision-making, such as adaptive trials (clinical trials and marketing and advertising experiments), personalization, and recommendation systems.
My expertise lies in areas that are growing in importance in marketing science including multi-arm bandits, reinforcement learning, Bayesian learning,  and machine learning.
 
My editorial experience includes editing a special issue of Management Science on prescriptive analytics, editing a special issue of IJRM, being a member of the editorial board at IJRM, and reviewing manuscripts for Marketing Science, Management Science, Journal of Marketing Research and IJRM. 


My on-going research projects include arm design for multi-armed bandits, fairness in bandits, seeding and targeting bandits, and adaptive clinical trials.

## Startups Public speaking

I support machine learning Dutch-based startups on multi-armed bandits, natural language processsing and on the design and execution of optimal clinical trials. I also did litigation work and consulting on machine learning-related topics.
